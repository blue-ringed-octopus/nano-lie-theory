            <p>This tutorial provides some informal interpretation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01537" target=”_blank” > A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics</a>. 
                Here, we emphasize on application and we will provide various examples for better understanding. You are strongly recommended to read the original paper before proceeding. The notations used in this article will be consistent to the paper. </p>
            <p> In short, we want to use a tiny portion of Lie theory to handle representation of rotation in both control and state estimation. By transforming between the tangent space and manifold, 
                we can effectively parameterize coordinate transformations; handle symmetries; define uncertainty; and define derivatives. </p>

            <h2 id="primer"> Primer  </h2>
            <hr>
            <p> This section briefly explains the undergraduate level basics of rigid transformation before introducing Lie theory. Those who are familiar can skip to the next section</p>
            <p> <h3> Transformation Matrix  </h3></p>
            <P> A matrix can be think of as an operator that moves a point into a different point in the same space. 
                These points are represented in the form of a vector. Each entry of the vector represents the contribution of each 
                standard basis vector. <br>
            </P>
            <p> <center> \(v =\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3  \end{bmatrix} = c_1e_1+c_2e_2+c_3e_3 \)</center></p>
            <p> The columns of a transformation matrix tells us where each basis gets mapped to </p>
            <p> <center> \(\begin{bmatrix} \mid & \mid & \mid \\
                b_1 & b_2 & b_3\\
                \mid & \mid & \mid \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0  \end{bmatrix}  = 
                b_1 \), \(\begin{bmatrix} \mid & \mid & \mid \\
                b_1 & b_2 & b_3\\
                \mid & \mid & \mid \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0  \end{bmatrix}  = 
                b_2 \), \(\begin{bmatrix} \mid & \mid & \mid \\
                b_1 & b_2 & b_3\\
                \mid & \mid & \mid \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1  \end{bmatrix}  = 
                b_3 \) </center></p>

            <p> Combining the two, the matrix transformation can be think of applying the weighted sum to the transformed basis.</p>
            <p> <center> \(\begin{bmatrix} \mid & \mid & \mid \\
                                             v_1 & v_2 & v_3\\
                                             \mid & \mid & \mid \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3  \end{bmatrix}  = 
                                             v_1c_1+v_2c_2+v_3c_3 \)</center></p>
            
            <p> All matrix transformation can be think of as a combination of the following 5 geometric operations: 
                <br> 1. scale 2.rotate 3.shear 4.reflect 5.projection </p>
            <p> <h3> Rotation Matrix </h3></p>
            <p> In 2 dimensions, the rotation matrix is often introduced as </p>
            <p> <center> \(R = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta\\
                                            \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \)</center></p>
            <p> because it has an intuitive geometric interpretation where \(\theta\) is the counter-clockwise angle of rotation.
                Later we will show how generalizing this form into higher dimension will be problemetic. It is more useful to define it 
            by its fundamental proeprties. For the matrix to be non-scaling and non-shearing, the column vectors of the matrix has to be 
            orthogonormal i.e.  </p>
            <p> <center> \(R = \begin{bmatrix} \mid & \mid &\\
                v_1 & v_2 & \cdots \\
                \mid & \mid & \end{bmatrix} \)</center></p>
            <p> <center> \( v_{i}\cdot v_{i} = 1 \)</center></p>
            <p> <center> \( v_{i}\cdot v_{j} = 0 \text{ if } i\neq j \)</center></p>
            Or more compactly,
            <p> <center> \(R^TR = RR^T = I \)</center></p>
            In addition, to exclude reflection, the determinant of the matrix has to be positive 1
            <p> <center> \( \text{det}(R) = 1\)</center></p>
            <p> Side note, this means that the matrix has even numbers of negative eigenvalues, which also means that any pair of reflection forms a rotation </p>
            <p> <h3> Rigid Transformation Matrix </h3></p>
            <p> A rigid transformation is a combination of rotation and translation, both preserve the shape of the set of points after 
                the transformation. It can be written in the form of </p>
            <p> <center> \( x_2 = Rx_1 + t \)</center></p>
            <p>where \(R\) is the rotaion matrix, \(x\) is point, and \(t\) is the translation. Translation is not a linear operation 
                because the zero element is not preserved. However it is an affine operation, which we can augment to a linear form by
                introducing the homogenous coordinate. 
            </p>
            <p> <center> \( \begin{bmatrix} x_2 \\1 \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}R & t\\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\1 \end{bmatrix} \)</center></p>
            <p> Essentially, the translation is performed by lifting the point to the homogenous coordinate, 
                and then perform a shearing transformation on an extra dimention.</p>
            <p><center><img src="resource/homogeneous.png"  style="border: 2px solid #555; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"></center></p> 
            
            <p> <h3> Reference Frame </h3></p>
            <p> Instead of transforming vectors, the transformation matrix can be treated as a transformation between reference frame. 
                The column vectors is the basis of the observed frame in the global coordinate. This can be used to represent a sequence of 
                robot's poses over time, or a tree of relative position of the links of a robot arm.</p>
                <p><center><img src="resource/transform1.png"  style="border: 2px solid #555;"></center></p> 

               <p> More importantly, applying the transformation
                matrix to a vector can be considered a change of basis from the observed frame to the global frame. </p>

            <h2 id="motivation">Motivating Examples</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> If you are wonder why do we bother learning Lie theory, this section will give you a glimpse on the trouble we face when dealing with rotations. 
                If you are already struggling with rotation, you can skip this part promptly. </p>
            <p> <h3> Example 1: Planar Rotation </h3></p>
            <p> For the first example, consider a simple proportional control on 2D rotation \(SO(2)\). We have a reference angle \(\theta_{ref}\) we wish the robot to rotate to; and the current angle of the robot 
                \(\theta_{t} \). we implement a naive linear proportional controller</p>
            <p> <center> \( u_{t} = K(\theta_{ref} - \theta_{t}) \)</center></p>
            <p> <center> \( \theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} + u_{t} \)</center></p>
            <p> lets say \(\theta_{ref} = \pi/4\), \(\theta_{0} = 0\), \(K=0.05\)  </p>
            
            <p><center><img src="src/ex1.gif"  style="border: 2px solid #555;"></center></p> 

            <p> this worked as expected. </p>
            
            <p>Now try \(\theta_{ref} = \frac{3}{2}\pi\)</p>
            <p><center><img src="src/ex2.gif"  style="border: 2px solid #555;"></center></p> 
            <p>  Not the smartest way to do it, it's a lot more efficient if the robot rotates clockwise to the reference pose</p>

            <p>Even worst, see \(\theta_{ref} = 2\pi\), we know \(2\pi\) is exactly the same as \(0\) for rotation, but for our controller:</p>
            <p><center><img src="src/ex3.gif"  style="border: 2px solid #555;"></center></p> 
            <p> the naive controller has no idea about the cyclic nature of rotation, it's simply trying to drive \(0\) toward \(2\pi\) on the real number line, worse, any number larger than \(2\pi\) causes a huge 
                difference and causes a proportionally large input to the robot. The same problem exists in state estimation. Consider two sensors measuring an angle, one measured \(5^{\circ}\), 
                another measured \(355^{\circ}\), our intuition tells us the mean should be \(0\), because both are 5 degrees away from 0, one from each sides. But if we naively get the average between the two numbers, we get \(180^{\circ}\), 
                the exact opposite of what we want.</p>

            <p> <h3> Example 2: 3D rotation </h3></p>
            <p> The 2D rotation can be handled by some smart combinations of modulus and min, but things get more complicated in 3D. Lets say we represent the rotation in a matrix form </p>
            <p> <center> \(R_{1}, R_{2} \in SO(3) \) </center></p>
            <p> \(SO\) stands for <i> special orthogonal group</i>, \((3)\) denotes it is in dimension 3. Matrices in \(SO(3)\) are \(3\times 3\). For a valid rotation, 
                the columns of the matrix has to be orthogonal to each other; all columns are normalized, and the determinant of the matrix is \(+1\), Plainly speaking, 
                the matrix does not stretch, skew, or reflect any vector when it is applied to the vector. Now we want to get an average between two rotation matrices \(R_1, R_2\). 
                We can naively do that arithmetically </p>
            
            <p> <center> \( \bar{R} = \frac{1}{2}(R_{1}+R_{2}\)) </center></p>
            <p> The problem is that the result is not guaranteed to be a valid rotation matrix. This problem is demonstrated by 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdDfQp4ODVw&ab_channel=SamJafarian">this youtube video.</a> </p>

            <p> Rotation in 3D has 3 degrees of freedom. With this, we can decompose the rotation matrix into 3 2D rotation matrices, each corresponds to rotation around the x, y, z axes. 
                These matrices are parameterized by the angle of rotation row, pitch ,and yaw respectively. This is called the <i>Euler angles</i> representation. Doing arithmetic in euler angles guarantees us 
                to maintain valid rotation. Euler angles are notoriously problematic. For instance, gimbal lock, where the matrix loses a degree of freedom due to two of the rotation axes lining up. And more 
                relevantly, interpolating two sets of euler angles does not create the most efficient path between the two poses, as shown in 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Y3DwOqaEA&ab_channel=SamJafarian">this video</a>. This means that when we fuse two sources of measurements, the weighted average can have a pose that is 
                completely different from any of the two measurements.  
            </p>

            <p> Lie theory provides us a unified method to tackle all these problems at once, regardless of the dimension, and extends beyond rotations.   </p>

            <h2 id="manifold"> Manifold  </h2>
            <hr>
            <p> The most important concepts we need to understand in order to apply Lie theory are manifold and tangent space. Formally, a manifold is a set of elements that satisfies 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Closure</b>: multiply two elements in the set and the result is also an element in the set <br>
                    Example: Rotating by \(\theta_1\), followed by rotating by \(\theta_2\), is equivalent to rotating by \(\theta_1+\theta_2\), which is still a rotation action
                    <p> <center> \(\begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos(\theta_1) & -\sin(\theta_1)\\ 
                        \sin(\theta_1) & \cos(\theta_1)
                        \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos(\theta_2) & -\sin(\theta_2)\\ 
                        \sin(\theta_2) & \cos(\theta_2)
                        \end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos(\theta_1+\theta_2) & -\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)\\ 
                        \sin(\theta_1+\theta_2) & \cos(\theta_1+\theta_2)
                        \end{bmatrix}  \)</center>  </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Identity</b> : any element multiplied to the identity result in itself, it represents non-action. <br>
                        Example: Rotate by \(0\) degree results in identity matrix
                        <p> <center> \(\begin{bmatrix}
                            \cos(0) & -\sin(0)\\ 
                            \sin(0) & \cos(0)
                            \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
                            1 & 0\\ 
                            0 & 1
                            \end{bmatrix}  \)</center>  </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Inverse</b> : for all elements in the set, there exists an inverse that will undo the action. <br>
                        Example: Inverting a rotation matrix is equivalent to rotating in the reverse direction, which undo the original rotation
                        <p> <center> \(\begin{bmatrix}
                            \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta)\\ 
                            \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
                            \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
                            \cos(\theta) & \sin(\theta)\\ 
                            -\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
                            \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix}
                            \cos(-\theta) & -\sin(-\theta)\\ 
                            \sin(-\theta) & \cos(-\theta)
                            \end{bmatrix}\)</center>  </p>
                    </li>  
                    <li><b>Associativity</b> : Multiplication for matrices are always associative. In our context, rotating an element sequentially by multiple matrices 
                        is equivalent to combining all the matrices into a single rotation matrix (by closure property), then rotate the element with the combined matrix</li>  
                </ul>

                <p> The above properties defined a <i> group </i>. In addition, if the group locally resembles Euclidean space, that is, the local neighborhood of any point can be continuously mapped to 
                    \(\mathbb{R}^n\) without creating holes, and the mapping is bijective, then we call it a manifold. A lie group is a manifold that is differentiable, namely, there are no sharp corners on the manifold. 
                </p>
                <p> It is helpful to think of a hypersurface embedded in a higher dimensional space in order to "visualize" the operations. For example, unit complex number living in a 2D plane \(x+yi\), but constrainted by 
                    the relation \(x^2+y^2=1\), making it a 1D manifold (a circle). Similarly 2D rotation matrices are 2x2 matrix \(\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}\), but with only 1 degree of freedom, 
                    making it a 1D surface embedded in \(\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}\) space. Refer back to figure 1 of 
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01537" target=”_blank” > micro Lie theory</a> for better visualization.</p>

                <p> A <b>tangent space</b> is a linear hyper plane tangents to any point on the manifold. The tangent space at the identity is called Lie algebra. The tangent space is useful because 
                    it is a vector space, with all vectors corresponds to a point on the manifold, and the dimension of the vector equal to the degrees of freedom of the manifold. With that, we can perform meaningful 
                    With that, we can perform meaningful operations like addition, subtraction, and calculus, in their usual vector definition. In robotic context, the Lie algebra can be think of
                    as the global coordinate; and the tangent spaces are the local coordinates anywhere in the workspace. This is useful because any measurements the robot takes, or any action the robot performs 
                    are, most of the time, local to the robot's frame at the time of execution instead of the global frame.

                <p><h3>Example:</h3> <br>
                    \(\theta\) is the tangent space of the Lie group \(SO(2)\), 
                    <p> <center> \(\begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta)\\ 
                        \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
                        \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \theta \) </center>  </p>
                    unlike the rotation matrices themselves, we can add and subtract the angles 
                    <p> <center> \( \theta'=\theta+d\theta\) </center>  </p>

                    and we can put the result back to the manifold 
                    <p> <center> \( \theta' \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos(\theta') & -\sin(\theta')\\ 
                        \sin(\theta') & \cos(\theta')
                        \end{bmatrix} \) </center>  </p>

                    <p>Note that the tangent vector can be extended to infinity, but the manifold representation is bounded. This can be visualized by wrapping the vector around the circular manifold. The vector 
                        wraps around on the surface and never escape. Using this property, we can handle the rotational symmetry by wrapping an angle on to the manifold, and find the tangent space representation of the corresponding 
                        element. This gives us the angle wrapping formula
                    </p>
                    <p> <center> \(\theta = \text{atan2}(\text{sin}(\theta) ,\text{cos}(\theta)) \)</center>  </p> 

                    The new \(\theta\) will always be in the range \((-\pi, \pi]\)

                These transformation between the manifold and the tangent space are called the log and exp operators. The <b>log(\(\cdot\))</b> map takes a vector on the tangent space and "wrap" it onto the manifold, 
                returning the group representation. The line formed on the surface is called the <i>geodesic</i>,
                which is the shortest path between the element at the origin and the target element returned by the log map. The <b>exp(\(\cdot\))</b> map takes a group element and
                unwrap it on to the Lie algebra.

                The matrix log does not return \(\theta\) directly as promised. While the tangent space is a vector space, the elements are not necessarily a cartesian vector. 
                However, they can be represented by a cartesian vector as linear combination of the base elements of the space. For this example, since 2D rotation has 1 degree of freedom, there is only one basis

                is the <i> axis-angle representation</i> of the rotation, where the direction of the vector is the axis of rotation, and the magnitude of the vector is the angle of rotation. Sometimes

                The operation of turning a tangent space representation to a cartesian vector is called <i> Vee </i>, denoted by \((\cdot)^\vee\). The inverse is <i>hat</i>, denoted by \((\cdot)^\wedge\). 
                A generic cartesian representation is denoted as \(\tau\), so the tangent space representation is \( \tau^\wedge \), and \((\tau^\wedge)^\vee = \tau\). For the \(SO(3)\) example,

            <p>  <center>\( \omega^\wedge = [\omega]_\times \)</center></p>
            <p>  <center>\( ([\omega]_\times)^\vee = \omega \)</center></p>

            <p>
                In general, we want to operate on the cartesian representation of the tangent space. So the exp and log, vee and hat are chained together to skip the non-cartesian representation, 
                namely, the capitalized \(\text{Log}(\cdot)\) and \(\text{Exp}(\cdot)\). Where

                The \(\oplus\) and \(\ominus\) operators allow us to perform increments and finding difference on the elements of the manifold directly. In robotic context, the goal is to keep all the
